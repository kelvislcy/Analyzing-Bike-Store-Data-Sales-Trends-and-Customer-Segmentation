# Exploring Bike Store Sales Data: Trends and Customer Segmentation

This project conducts an extensive analysis of sales trends and customer segmentation within a multi-year dataset from a bike store. Utilizing SQL, Pandas, and visualization tools like Plotly, the analysis uncovers crucial insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.

Key highlights include monthly sales trend analysis, customer preferences in product categories and brands, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to understand customer engagement and loyalty. The analysis culminates in compelling visualizations, empowering actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and informed decision-making.
