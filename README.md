# Exploring Bike Store Sales Data: Trends and Customer Segmentation

This project conducts an extensive analysis of sales trends and customer segmentation within a multi-year dataset from a bike store. Utilizing SQL, Pandas, and visualization tools like Plotly, the analysis uncovers crucial insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.

## Overview
This analysis dives into the following key objectives:
- Exploring sales patterns over time.
- Identifying popular product categories and preferred brands among customers.
- Evaluating store performance against the average sales across all stores.
- Conducting RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis for customer segmentation.

**Explore the Notebooks:**
- Navigate to the `Bike store report` directory to access Jupyter notebooks containing SQL queries, data analysis, and visualizations.
